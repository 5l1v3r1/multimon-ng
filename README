MultimonNG a fork of multimon. It decodes the following digital transmission modes:
POCSAG512 POCSAG1200 POCSAG2400 EAS UFSK1200 CLIPFSK AFSK1200 AFSK2400 AFSK2400_2 AFSK2400_3 HAPN4800 FSK9600 DTMF ZVEI

The following changes have been made so far:
-Fixes for x64
-Basic functionality on Mac OS X 'Lion' (Soundcard/OSS input is unsupported)
-'DUMMY_AUDIO' "backend" (Gets rid of the OSS dependency, breaks audio in doing so)
-Option 'NO_X11' to disable the X11 dependency since Apple will drop Xorg soon
-Override mode for POCSAG decoding (e.g. force text decoding)
-Verbose mode is now listed in '-h'
-Merged Debian patches for EAS (Emergency Alert System) decoding (untested)
-Portability is a major goal, it now even compiles on Windows/Cygwin (without OSS/X11)

In addition to the 'Makefile' there is also a file ('multimonNG.pro') for qmake.
So far this has only been tested on OS X, though adding support for new operating
systems should be easy.
