MultimonNG is my fork of multimon.

The following changes have been made so far:
-Fixes for x64
-Basic functionality on Mac OS X 'Lion' (Soundcard/OSS input is unsupported)
-DUMMY_AUDIO "backend" (Gets rid of the OSS dependency, breaks audio in doing so)
-Override mode for POCSAG decoding (e.g. force text decoding)
-Verbose mode is now listed in '-h'
-Merged Debian patches for EAS (Emergency Alert System) decoding (untested)

In addition to the 'Makefile' there is also a file ('multimonNG.pro') for qmake.
So far this has only been tested on OS X, though adding support for new operating
systems should be easy.
